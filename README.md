##Install
First, you'll need to get the C library `libqrencode` from [here](https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode)

Then type
```stack install```
in the appropriate library.

To make sure bash completions run correctly, run `bash/mkCompletions` as well.

##Usage
To help you get started, there is a bash file called `examples` in the appropriate directory, which has many of the common commands you will issue.
